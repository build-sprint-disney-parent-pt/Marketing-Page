# Disney Parent

## Project Outline

### Pitch 
Magic at Your Fingertips- find parents at the park to swap childcare and stroller passes with! Enhance your Disney Experience as parents by connecting with other parents, allowing you to go on all the 'big kid' rides together.

### MVP

1.  An on-boarding process for parents
2.  On-boarding process for a volunteer experienced business owner
3.  Ability to easily create and post a request (including meeting place/ride and time, and number of kids you have)
4.  Ability to easily edit / delete a question
5.  Ability for anyone to easily search / find posted requests (filter by time, location place, general search)
6.  Ability for a second parent user to log in and respond to the request

### Stretch 
Use a notification API like Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) or Growl (http://growl.info/) for notifications when your request has been answered, or when new requests are posted.
